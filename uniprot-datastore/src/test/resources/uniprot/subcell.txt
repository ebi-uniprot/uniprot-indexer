ID   Acidocalcisome.
AC   SL-0002
DE   The acidocalcisome is an electron-dense acidic organelle which
DE   contains a matrix of pyrophosphate and polyphosphates with bound
DE   calcium and other cations. Its limiting membrane possesses a number of
DE   pumps and exchangers for the uptake and release of these elements. The
DE   acidocalcisome does not belong to the endocytic pathway and may
DE   represent a branch of the secretory pathway in trypanosomatids and
DE   apicomplexan parasites. The acidocalcisome is possibly involved in
DE   polyphosphate and cation storage and in adaptation of these
DE   microoganisms to environmental stress.

DE   the cytoplasm of cells. The cytoskeleton is responsible for cell
DE   movement, cytokinesis, and the organization of the organelles or
DE   organelle-like structures within the cell. The major components of the
DE   cytoskeleton are the microfilaments (of actin), microtubules (of
DE   tubulin), the intermediate filament systems and a fourth group, the
DE   MinD-ParA group, that appears to be unique to bacteria.

DE   from axons of other neurons, and convey the resulting signal to the
DE   body of the cell.
SL   Cell projection, dendrite.

GO   GO:0030425; dendrite
//
ID   Synapse.
AC   SL-0258
DE   Synapses are the communicating cell-cell junctions that allow signals
DE   to pass from a nerve cell to a target cell. In a chemical synapse, the
DE   signal is carried by a neurotransmitter which diffuses across a narrow
DE   synaptic cleft and activates a receptor on the postsynaptic membrane
DE   of the target cell. The target may be a dendrite, cell body, neuronal
DE   axon, a specialized region of a muscle or a secretory cell. In an
DE   electrical synapse, a direct connection is made between the cytoplasms
DE   of two cells via gap junctions.
SL   Cell junction, synapse.

AC   SL-0261
DE   Synaptosomes are the pinched-off nerve endings and their contents of
DE   vesicles and cytoplasm together with the attached subsynaptic area of
DE   the membrane of the postsynaptic cell. They are largely artificial
DE   structures produced by fractionation after selective centrifugation of
DE   nervous tissue homogenates.

ID   Postsynaptic density.
AC   SL-0297
DE   The postsynaptic membrane contains a high concentration of glutamate
DE   receptors, associated signaling proteins, and cytoskeletal elements,
DE   all assembled by a variety of scaffold proteins into an organized
DE   structure called the postsynaptic density (PSD). A complex machine
DE   made of hundreds of distinct proteins, the PSD dynamically changes its
DE   structure and composition during development and in response to
DE   synaptic activity.

AC   SL-0162
DE   A membrane is a lipid bilayer which surrounds enclosed spaces and
DE   compartments. This selectively permeable structure is essential for
DE   effective separation of a cell or organelle from its surroundings.
DE   Membranes are composed of various types of molecules such as
DE   phospholipids, integral membrane proteins, peripheral proteins,
DE   glycoproteins, glycolipids, etc. The relative amounts of these
DE   components as well as the types of lipids are non-randomly distributed
