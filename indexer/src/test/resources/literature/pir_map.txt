Q96R06	ORCID	28751710	0000-0001-8295-3689	[Function][Subcellular location][Interaction]Protein/gene_name: Astrin. Function: Astrin-SKAP complex is required for stabilizing kinetochore-microtubule attachment independent of biorientation. Comments: Astrin-SKAP complex is an excellent marker of end-on chromosome-microtubule attachments. It is recruited specifically to kinetochores attached to microtubule-ends, independent of biorientation status.

Q96GD4	ORCID	28751710	0000-0001-8295-3689	[Function][Subcellular location]Protein/gene_name: Function: Aurora-B kinase localized at the outer-kinetochore region blocks the end-on conversion process. Kinetochores remain tethered to microtubule walls and can not be attached to microtubule-ends. Comments: Aurora-B kinase can be found in the outer kinetochore region. This localization is particularly common on immature kinetochores attached to microtubule walls.
