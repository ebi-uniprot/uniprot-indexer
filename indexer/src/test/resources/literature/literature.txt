RL   Biochemistry 14:5253-5256(1975).

IP   24

Above pH 8.5, pepsinogen is converted into a form which cannot be activated
to pepsin on exposure to low pH. Intermediate exposure to neutral pH,
however, returns the protein to a form which can be activated. Evidence is
presented for a reversible, small conformational change in the molecule,
distinct from the unfolding of the protein. At the same time, the molecule
is converted to a form of limited solubility, which is precipitated at low
pH, where activation is normally seen. The results are interpreted in terms
of the peculiar structure of the pepsinogen molecule. Titration of the
basic NH2-terminal region produced an open form, which can return to the
native form at neutral pH, but which is maintained at low pH by
neutralization of carboxylate groups in the pepsin portion.

RT   "Purification and properties of Escherichia coli dihydrofolate
RT   reductase.";
RL   Biochemistry 14:5267-5273(1975).

IP   24

Dihydrofolate reductase has been purified 40-fold to apparent homogeneity
from a trimethoprim-resistant strain of Escherichia coli (RT 500) using a
procedure that includes methotrexate affinity column chromatography.
Determinations of the molecular weight of the enzyme based on its amino
acid composition, sedimentation velocity, and sodium dodecyl sulfate gel
electrophoresis gave values of 17680, 17470 and 18300, respectively. An
aggregated form of the enzyme with a low specific activity can be separated
from the monomer by gel filtration; treatment of the aggregate with
mercaptoethanol or dithiothreitol results in an increase in enzymic
activity and a regeneration of the monomer. Also, multiple molecular forms
of the monomer have been detected by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
The unresolved enzyme exhibits two pH optima (pH 4.5 and pH 7.0) with
dihydrofolate as a substrate. Highest activities are observed in buffers
containing large organic cations. In 100 mM imidazolium chloride (pH 7),
the specific activity is 47 mumol of dihydrofolate reduced per min per mg
at 30 degrees. Folic acid also serves as a substrate with a single pH
optimum of pH 4.5. At this pH the Km for folate is 16 muM, and the Vmax is
1/1000 of the rate observed with dihydrofolate as the substrate. Monovalent
cations (Na+, K+, Rb+, and Cs+) inhibit dihydrofolate reductase; at a given
ionic strength the degree of inhibition is a function of the ionic radius
of the cation. Divalent cations are more potent inhibitors; the I50 of
BaCl2 is 250 muM, as compared to 125 mM for KCl. Anions neither inhibit nor
activate the enzyme.

RT   "The reaction between the superoxide anion radical and cytochrome c.";
RL   Biochim. Biophys. Acta 408:215-222(1975).

IP   3

1. The superoxide anion radical (O2-) reacts with ferricytochrome c to form
ferrocytochrome c. No intermediate complexes are observable. No reaction
could be detected between O2-
and ferrocytochrome c. 2. At 20 degrees C the rate constant for the
reaction at pH 4.7 to 6.7 is 1.4-10(6) M-1. S -1 and as the pH increases
above 6.7 the rate constant steadily decreases. The dependence on pH is the
same for tuna heart and horse heart cytochrome c. No reaction could be
demonstrated between O2-
and the form of cytochrome c which exists above pH approximately 9.2. The
dependence of the rate constant on pH can be explained if cytochrome c has
pKs of 7.45 and 9.2, and O2-
reacts with the form present below pH 7.45 with k = 1.4-10(6) M-1 -
S-1, the form above pH 7.45 with k = 3.0- 10(5) M-1 -
S-1, and the form present above pH 9.2 with k = 0. 3. The reaction has an
activation energy of 20 kJ mol-1 and an enthalpy of activation at 25
degrees C of 18 kJ mol-1 both above and below pH 7.45. It is suggested that
O2-
may reduce cytochrome c through a track composed of aromatic amino acids,
and that little protein rearrangement is required for the formation of the
activated complex. 4. No reduction of ferricytochrome c by HO2 radicals
could be demonstrated at pH 1.2-6.2 but at pH 5.3, HO2 radicals oxidize
ferrocytochrome c with a rate constant of about 5-10(5)-5-10(6) M-1 - S-1.

RL   Biochim. Biophys. Acta 410:21-31(1975).

IP   1

1. The pH dependencies of the apparent Michaelis constant for oxidized
glutathione and the apparent turnover number of yeast glutathione reductase
(EC 1.6.4.2) have been determined at a fixed concentration of 0.1 mM NADPH
in the range pH 4.5--8.0. Between pH 5.5 and 7.6, both of these parameters
are relatively constant. The principal effect of low pH on the kinetics of
the enzyme-catalyzed reaction is the observation of a pH-dependent
substrate inhibition by oxidized glutathione at pH less than or equal 7,
which is shown to correlate with the binding of oxidized glutathione to the
oxidized form of the enzyme. 2. The catalytic activity of yeast glutathione
reductase at pH 5.5 is affected by the sodium acetate buffer concentration.
The stability of the oxidized and reduced forms of the enzyme at pH 5.5 and
25 degrees C in the absence of bovine serum albumin was studied as a
function of sodium acetate concentration. The results show that activation
of the catalytic activity of the enzyme at low sodium acetate concentration
correlates with an effect of sodium acetate on a reduced form of the
enzyme. In contrast, inhibition of the catalytic activity of the enzyme at
high sodium acetate concentration correlates with an effect of sodium
acetate on the oxidized form of the enzyme.

RL   J. Bacteriol. 124:1067-1076(1975).

IP   3

The purification and properties of a novel type of murein transglycosylase
from Escherichia coli are described. The purified enzyme appears as a
single band on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels and has an
apparent molecular weight of approximately 65,000 as estimated by gel
filtration and gel electrophoresis. It degrades pure murein sacculi from E.
coli almost completely into low-molecular-weight products. The two
prominent muropeptide fragments in the digest are the disaccharide-
tripeptide N-acetylglucosamine-N-acetylmuramic acid-L-alanine-D-iso-
glutamic acid-meso-diaminopimelic acid and the corresponding disaccharide-
tetrapeptide N-acetylglucosamine-N-acetylmuramic acid-L-alanine-D-iso-
glutamic acid-meso-diaminopimelic acid-D-alanine. The unique feature of
these compounds is that the disaccharide has no reducing end group and that
the muramic acid residue possesses an internal 1 leads to 6 anhydro
linkage. The new lytic enzyme is designated as a murein: murein
transglycosylase. Its possible role in the rearrangement of murein during
cell growth and division is discussed.

In 1992, Xie et al. identified a cDNA sequence in the expression cloning
search for the kappa opioid receptor. When the cDNA was expressed in Cos-7
cells, binding of opioid compounds was observed to be of low affinity and
without kappa, mu, or delta selectivity [Xie, G.-X., Miyajima, A. and
Goldstein, A. (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89, 4124-4128]. This cDNA
was highly homologous to the human neurokinin-3 (NK-3) receptor sequence,
and displayed lower homology to NK-1 and NK-2 sequences. This sequence was
stably expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells, which do not express
neurokinin receptors naturally, and ligand binding and second messenger
characteristics were compared with a human NK-3 receptor. The NK-3 receptor
homolog bound [3H] senktide with a Kd of 39 nM, similar to that of the NK-3
receptor. The rank order of tachykinin peptides competing for [3H]senktide
binding at the NK-3 receptor homolog was [MePhe7]neurokinin B > senktide >
substance P = neurokinin A > neurokinin B. This cell line also bound [125I-
MePhe7]neurokinin B; however, neurokinin B was an effective competitor.
Tachykinin peptides stimulated both inositol phospholipid hydrolysis and
arachidonic acid release at NK-3 and NK-3 receptor homolog cell lines, with
similar rank orders of potency of [MePhe7] neurokinin B = neurokinin B =
senktide > NKA = substance P. These results indicate that expression of the
NK-3 receptor homolog cDNA in the Chinese hamster ovary cell system induces
the expression of a receptor site with many similarities but certain key
differences from that of the human NK-3 receptor. The results are discussed
with reference to the existence of a novel human tachykinin receptor.

IP   2

The flavoprotein isobutylamine N-hydroxylase (IBAH) catalyzes the oxidation
of isobutylamine to isobutylhydroxylamine, a key step in the biosynthesis
of the azoxy antibiotic valanimycin. By using oligonucleotide primers
designed from peptide sequence information derived from native IBAH, a
fragment of the gene (vlmH) encoding IBAH was amplified by PCR from a
genomic library of the valanimycin-producing organism, Streptomyces
viridifaciens MG456-hF10. The gene fragment was then employed as a probe to
clone the entire vlmH gene from an S. viridifaciens genomic library.
Overexpression of the vlmH gene in Escherichia coli gave a soluble protein
that was purified to homogeneity. The purified protein exhibited the
catalytic activity expected for IBAH. The deduced amino acid sequence of
IBAH exhibited the greatest similarity to the Sox/DszC protein from
Rhodococcus sp. strain IGT38, a flavoprotein involved in the oxidation of
dibenzothiophene to the corresponding sulfone. Significant similarities
were also found between the amino acid sequence of IBAH and those of the
acyl coenzyme A dehydrogenases.

RT   controls the function of epithelial signaling centers and is regulated

RL   Dev. Biol. 229:443-455(2001).

IP   2

Ectodermal dysplasia syndromes affect the development of several organs,
including hair, teeth, and   glands. The recent cloning of two genes
responsible for these syndromes has led to the identification of a   novel
TNF family ligand, ectodysplasin, and TNF receptor, edar. This has
indicated a developmental   regulatory role for TNFs for the first time.
Our in situ hybridization analysis of the expression of   ectodysplasin
(encoded by the Tabby gene) and edar (encoded by the downless gene) during
mouse   tooth morphogenesis showed that they are expressed in complementary
patterns exclusively in   ectodermal tissue layer. Edar was expressed
reiteratively in signaling centers regulating key steps in   morphogenesis.
The analysis of the effects of eight signaling molecules in the TGFbeta,
FGF, Hh, Wnt, and   EGF families in tooth explant cultures revealed that
the expression of edar was induced by activinbetaA,   whereas Wnt6 induced
ectodysplasin expression. Moreover, ectodysplasin expression was
downregulated in branchial arch epithelium and in tooth germs of Lef1
mutant mice, suggesting that   signaling by ectodysplasin is regulated by
LEF-1-mediated Wnt signals. The analysis of the signaling   centers in
tooth germs of Tabby mice (ectodysplasin null mutants) indicated that in
the absence of   ectodysplasin the signaling centers were small. However,
no downstream targets of ectodysplasin   signaling were identified among
several genes expressed in the signaling centers. We conclude that
ectodysplasin functions as a planar signal between ectodermal compartments
and regulates the function,   but not the induction, of epithelial
signaling centers. This TNF signaling is tightly associated with
epithelial-mesenchymal interactions and with other signaling pathways
regulating organogenesis. We   suggest that activin signaling from
mesenchyme induces the expression of the TNF receptor edar in the
epithelial signaling centers, thus making them responsive to Wnt-induced
ectodysplasin from the nearby   ectoderm. This is the first demonstration
of integration of the Wnt, activin, and TNF signaling pathways.

RT   "Genetic fine mapping and genomic annotation defines causal mechanisms
RT   at type 2 diabetes susceptibility loci.";
RL   Nat. Genet. 47:1415-1425(2015).

IP   12

We performed fine mapping of 39 established type 2 diabetes (T2D) loci in
27,206 cases and 57,574 controls of European ancestry. We identified 49
distinct association signals at these loci, including five mapping in or
near KCNQ1. 'Credible sets' of the variants most likely to drive each
distinct signal mapped predominantly to noncoding sequence, implying that
association with T2D is mediated through gene regulation. Credible set
variants were enriched for overlap with FOXA2 chromatin immunoprecipitation
binding sites in human islet and liver cells, including at MTNR1B, where
fine mapping implicated rs10830963 as driving T2D association. We confirmed
that the T2D risk allele for this SNP increases FOXA2-bound enhancer
activity in islet-
and liver-derived cells. We observed allele-specific differences in NEUROD1
binding in islet-derived cells, consistent with evidence that the T2D risk
allele increases islet MTNR1B expression. Our study demonstrates how
integration of genetic and genomic information can define molecular
mechanisms through which variants underlying association signals exert
their effects on disease.

RL   Lancet 366:1945-1953(2005).

IP   9501

BACKGROUND: An acquired V617F mutation in JAK2 occurs in most patients with
polycythaemia vera, but is seen in only half those with essential
thrombocythaemia and idiopathic myelofibrosis. We aimed to assess whether
patients with the mutation are biologically distinct from those without,
and why the same mutation is associated with different disease phenotypes.
METHODS: Two sensitive PCR-based methods were used to assess the JAK2
mutation status of 806 patients with essential thrombocythaemia, including
776 from the Medical Research Council's Primary Thrombocythaemia trial (MRC
PT-1) and two other prospective studies. Laboratory and clinical features,
response to treatment, and clinical events were compared for V617F-positive
and V617F-negative patients with essential thrombocythaemia. FINDINGS:
Mutation-positive patients had multiple features resembling polycythaemia
vera, with significantly increased haemoglobin (mean increase 9.6 g/L, 95%
CI 7.6-11.6 g/L; p<0.0001), neutrophil counts (1.1x10(9)/L, 0.7-
1.5x10(9)/L; p<0.0001), bone marrow erythropoiesis and granulopoiesis, more
venous thromboses, and a higher rate of polycythaemic transformation than
those without the mutation. Mutation-positive patients had lower serum
erythropoietin (mean decrease 13.8 U/L; 95% CI, 10.8-16.9 U/L; p<0.0001)
and ferritin (n=182; median 58 vs 91 mug/L; p=0.01) concentrations than did
mutation-negative patients. Mutation-negative patients did, nonetheless,
show many clinical and laboratory features that were characteristic of a
myeloproliferative disorder. V617F-positive individuals were more sensitive
to therapy with hydroxyurea, but not anagrelide, than those without the
JAK2 mutation. INTERPRETATION: Our results suggest that JAK2 V617F-positive
essential thrombocythaemia and polycythaemia vera form a biological
continuum, with the degree of erythrocytosis determined by physiological or
genetic modifiers.

It has been shown that a proteomic algorithm based on 8 MALDI TOF MS
signals obtained from plasma of NSCLC patients treated with EGFR TKIs, is
able to predict patients' clinical outcome. In the current study, we
identified the proteins originating 4 out of 8 mass signals in the
classification algorithm. Plasma samples collected before the beginning of
gefitinib therapy were analyzed by MALDI TOF MS and classified according to
the proteomic algorithm in good and poor profiles. Two pools of good and
poor classified samples were prepared using MARS and ProteoMiner Protein
Enrichment kit before 2DE analysis. Proteins differentially expressed
between good and poor 2DE samples were excised from gels and analyzed with
MALDI TOF MS and LC MS/MS. The identified proteins were validated by
Immunodepletion and Western blot analyses. serum amyloid A protein 1
(SAA1), together with its two truncated forms, was over-expressed in plasma
of poor classified patients, and was identified as the protein that
generates 4 out of the 8 mass signals composing the proteomic algorithm
VeriStrat. SAA levels measured by ELISA in 97 NSCLC patients treated with
gefitinib correlated with the clinical outcome of the patients. This
article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Integrated omics.
