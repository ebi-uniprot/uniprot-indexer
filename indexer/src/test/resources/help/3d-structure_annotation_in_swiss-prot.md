Manual annotation of entries with 3D-structures has high priority, for the following reasons:

*   3D-structures shed light on protein architecture and provide proof for the existence of a given protein fold.
*   They show the assembly of multi-protein complexes, and the details of interactions between different proteins, such as an enzyme and its target.
*   3D-structures yield detailed information about the interactions of a protein with its ligands (substrates, ions, cofactors or regulatory molecules), and so help to elucidate enzyme mechanisms and identify active site residues.
*   They help to attribute a function to so-far hypothetical proteins.
*   They show post-translational modifications.
*   3D-structures pinpoint the exact position of a residue that causes a genetic disease when it is mutated.
