GO:0000001	N	mitochondrion inheritance	The distribution of mitochondria, including the mitochondrial genome, into daughter cells after mitosis or meiosis, mediated by interactions between mitochondria and the cytoskeleton.
GO:0000002	N	mitochondrial genome maintenance	The maintenance of the structure and integrity of the mitochondrial genome; includes replication and segregation of the mitochondrial chromosome.
GO:0000003	N	reproduction	The production of new individuals that contain some portion of genetic material inherited from one or more parent organisms.
GO:0000005	Y	obsolete ribosomal chaperone activity	OBSOLETE. Assists in the correct assembly of ribosomes or ribosomal subunits in vivo, but is not a component of the assembled ribosome when performing its normal biological function.
GO:0000006	N	high-affinity zinc transmembrane transporter activity	Enables the transfer of zinc ions (Zn2+) from one side of a membrane to the other, probably powered by proton motive force. In high-affinity transport the transporter is able to bind the solute even if it is only present at very low concentrations.
GO:0000007	N	low-affinity zinc ion transmembrane transporter activity	Enables the transfer of a solute or solutes from one side of a membrane to the other according to the reaction: Zn2+ = Zn2+, probably powered by proton motive force. In low-affinity transport the transporter is able to bind the solute only if it is present at very high concentrations.
GO:0000008	Y	obsolete thioredoxin	OBSOLETE. A small disulfide-containing redox protein that serves as a general protein disulfide oxidoreductase. Interacts with a broad range of proteins by a redox mechanism, based on the reversible oxidation of 2 cysteine thiol groups to a disulfide, accompanied by the transfer of 2 electrons and 2 protons. The net result is the covalent interconversion of a disulfide and a dithiol.
GO:0000009	N	alpha-1,6-mannosyltransferase activity	Catalysis of the transfer of a mannose residue to an oligosaccharide, forming an alpha-(1->6) linkage.
GO:0000010	N	trans-hexaprenyltranstransferase activity	Catalysis of the reaction: all-trans-hexaprenyl diphosphate + isopentenyl diphosphate = all-trans-heptaprenyl diphosphate + diphosphate.
