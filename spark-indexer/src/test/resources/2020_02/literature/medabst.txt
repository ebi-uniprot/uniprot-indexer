Above pH 8.5, pepsinogen is converted into a form which cannot be activated to
pepsin on exposure to low pH. Intermediate exposure to neutral pH, however,
returns the protein to a form which can be activated. Evidence is presented for
a reversible, small conformational change in the molecule, distinct from the
unfolding of the protein. At the same time, the molecule is converted to a form
of limited solubility, which is precipitated at low pH, where activation is
normally seen. The results are interpreted in terms of the peculiar structure of
the pepsinogen molecule. Titration of the basic NH2-terminal region produced an
open form, which can return to the native form at neutral pH, but which is
maintained at low pH by neutralization of carboxylate groups in the pepsin
portion.

IP   24

Dihydrofolate reductase has been purified 40-fold to apparent homogeneity from a
trimethoprim-resistant strain of Escherichia coli (RT 500) using a procedure
that includes methotrexate affinity column chromatography. Determinations of the
molecular weight of the enzyme based on its amino acid composition,
sedimentation velocity, and sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis gave
values of 17680, 17470 and 18300, respectively. An aggregated form of the enzyme
with a low specific activity can be separated from the monomer by gel
filtration; treatment of the aggregate with mercaptoethanol or dithiothreitol
results in an increase in enzymic activity and a regeneration of the monomer.
Also, multiple molecular forms of the monomer have been detected by
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The unresolved enzyme exhibits two pH optima
(pH 4.5 and pH 7.0) with dihydrofolate as a substrate. Highest activities are
observed in buffers containing large organic cations. In 100 mM imidazolium
chloride (pH 7), the specific activity is 47 mumol of dihydrofolate reduced per
min per mg at 30 degrees. Folic acid also serves as a substrate with a single pH
optimum of pH 4.5. At this pH the Km for folate is 16 muM, and the Vmax is
1/1000 of the rate observed with dihydrofolate as the substrate. Monovalent
cations (Na+, K+, Rb+, and Cs+) inhibit dihydrofolate reductase; at a given
ionic strength the degree of inhibition is a function of the ionic radius of the
cation. Divalent cations are more potent inhibitors; the I50 of BaCl2 is 250
muM, as compared to 125 mM for KCl. Anions neither inhibit nor activate the
enzyme.

1. The superoxide anion radical (O2-) reacts with ferricytochrome c to form
ferrocytochrome c. No intermediate complexes are observable. No reaction could
be detected between O2-
and ferrocytochrome c. 2. At 20 degrees C the rate constant for the reaction at
pH 4.7 to 6.7 is 1.4-10(6) M-1. S -1 and as the pH increases above 6.7 the rate
constant steadily decreases. The dependence on pH is the same for tuna heart and
horse heart cytochrome c. No reaction could be demonstrated between O2-
and the form of cytochrome c which exists above pH approximately 9.2. The
dependence of the rate constant on pH can be explained if cytochrome c has pKs
of 7.45 and 9.2, and O2-
reacts with the form present below pH 7.45 with k = 1.4-10(6) M-1 -
S-1, the form above pH 7.45 with k = 3.0- 10(5) M-1 -
S-1, and the form present above pH 9.2 with k = 0. 3. The reaction has an
activation energy of 20 kJ mol-1 and an enthalpy of activation at 25 degrees C
of 18 kJ mol-1 both above and below pH 7.45. It is suggested that O2-
may reduce cytochrome c through a track composed of aromatic amino acids, and
that little protein rearrangement is required for the formation of the activated
complex. 4. No reduction of ferricytochrome c by HO2 radicals could be
demonstrated at pH 1.2-6.2 but at pH 5.3, HO2 radicals oxidize ferrocytochrome c
with a rate constant of about 5-10(5)-5-10(6) M-1 - S-1.

1. The pH dependencies of the apparent Michaelis constant for oxidized
glutathione and the apparent turnover number of yeast glutathione reductase (EC
1.6.4.2) have been determined at a fixed concentration of 0.1 mM NADPH in the
range pH 4.5--8.0. Between pH 5.5 and 7.6, both of these parameters are
relatively constant. The principal effect of low pH on the kinetics of the
enzyme-catalyzed reaction is the observation of a pH-dependent substrate
inhibition by oxidized glutathione at pH less than or equal 7, which is shown to
correlate with the binding of oxidized glutathione to the oxidized form of the
enzyme. 2. The catalytic activity of yeast glutathione reductase at pH 5.5 is
affected by the sodium acetate buffer concentration. The stability of the
oxidized and reduced forms of the enzyme at pH 5.5 and 25 degrees C in the
absence of bovine serum albumin was studied as a function of sodium acetate
concentration. The results show that activation of the catalytic activity of the
enzyme at low sodium acetate concentration correlates with an effect of sodium
acetate on a reduced form of the enzyme. In contrast, inhibition of the
catalytic activity of the enzyme at high sodium acetate concentration correlates
with an effect of sodium acetate on the oxidized form of the enzyme.

IP   3

The purification and properties of a novel type of murein transglycosylase from
Escherichia coli are described. The purified enzyme appears as a single band on
sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels and has an apparent molecular weight
of approximately 65,000 as estimated by gel filtration and gel electrophoresis.
It degrades pure murein sacculi from E. coli almost completely into low-
molecular-weight products. The two prominent muropeptide fragments in the digest
are the disaccharide-tripeptide N-acetylglucosamine-N-acetylmuramic acid-L-
alanine-D-iso-glutamic acid-meso-diaminopimelic acid and the corresponding
disaccharide-tetrapeptide N-acetylglucosamine-N-acetylmuramic acid-L-alanine-D-
iso-glutamic acid-meso-diaminopimelic acid-D-alanine. The unique feature of
these compounds is that the disaccharide has no reducing end group and that the
muramic acid residue possesses an internal 1 leads to 6 anhydro linkage. The new
lytic enzyme is designated as a murein: murein transglycosylase. Its possible
role in the rearrangement of murein during cell growth and division is
discussed.

IP   37

Jacob is a recently identified plasticity-related protein that couples N-methyl-
d-aspartate receptor activity to nuclear gene expression. An expression analysis
by Northern blot and in situ hybridization shows that Jacob is almost
exclusively present in brain, in particular in the cortex and the limbic system.
Alternative splicing gives rise to multiple mRNA variants, all of which exhibit
a prominent dendritic localization in the hippocampus. Functional analysis in
primary hippocampal neurons revealed that a predominant cis-acting dendritic
targeting element in the 3'-untranslated region of Jacob mRNAs is responsible
for dendritic mRNA localization. In the mouse brain, Jacob transcripts are
associated with both the fragile X mental retardation protein, a well described
trans-acting factor regulating dendritic mRNA targeting and translation, and the
kinesin family member 5C motor complex, which is known to mediate dendritic mRNA
transport. Jacob is susceptible to rapid protein degradation in a Ca(2+)-
and Calpain-dependent manner, and Calpain-mediated clipping of the myristoylated
N terminus of Jacob is required for its nuclear translocation after N-methyl-d-
aspartate receptor activation. Our data suggest that local synthesis in
dendrites may be necessary to replenish dendritic Jacob pools after truncation
of the N-terminal membrane anchor and concomitant translocation of Jacob to the
nucleus.

<h4>Background</h4>In recent years a number of potential synapto-nuclear protein
messengers have been characterized that are thought to be involved in
plasticity-related gene expression, and that have the capacity of importin-
mediated and activity-dependent nuclear import. However, there is a surprising
paucity of data showing the nuclear import of such proteins in cellular models
of learning and memory. Only recently it was found that the transcription factor
cyclic AMP response element binding protein 2 (CREB2) transits to the nucleus
during long-term depression (LTD), but not during long-term potentiation (LTP)
of synaptic transmission in hippocampal primary neurons. Jacob is another
messenger that couples NMDA-receptor-activity to nuclear gene expression. We
therefore aimed to study whether Jacob accumulates in the nucleus in
physiological relevant models of activity-dependent synaptic
plasticity.<h4>Methodology/principal findings</h4>We have analyzed the dynamics
of Jacob's nuclear import following induction of NMDA-receptor dependent LTP or
LTD at Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses in rat hippocampal slices. Using time-
lapse imaging of neurons expressing a Jacob-Green-Fluorescent-Protein we found
that Jacob rapidly translocates from dendrites to the nucleus already during the
tetanization period of LTP, but not after induction of LTD. Immunocytochemical
stainings confirmed the nuclear accumulation of endogenous Jacob in comparison
to apical dendrites after induction of LTP but not LTD. Complementary findings
were obtained after induction of NMDA-receptor dependent chemical LTP and LTD in
hippocampal primary neurons. However, in accordance with previous studies, high
concentrations of NMDA and glycine as well as specific activation of
extrasynaptic NMDA-receptors resembling pathological conditions induce an even
more profound increase of nuclear Jacob
levels.<h4>Conclusions/significance</h4>Taken together, these findings suggest
that the two major forms of NMDA-receptor dependent synaptic plasticity, LTP and
LTD, elicit the transition of different synapto-nuclear messengers albeit in
both cases importin-mediated retrograde transport and NMDA-receptor activation
is required.
