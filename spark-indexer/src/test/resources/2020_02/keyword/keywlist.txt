  This document lists the keywords and categories used in the UniProt
  knowledgebase (Swiss-Prot and TrEMBL). The keywords are classified into
  the following 10 categories:

    * Biological process
    * Cellular component
    * Coding sequence diversity
    * Developmental stage
    * Disease
    * Domain
    * Ligand
    * Molecular function
    * PTM
    * Technical term

  The definition of the keywords and categories usage as well as other
  information is provided in the following format:

  ---------  ---------------------------     ------------------------------

ID   2Fe-2S.
AC   KW-0001
DE   Protein which contains at least one 2Fe-2S iron-sulfur cluster: 2 iron
DE   atoms complexed to 2 inorganic sulfides and 4 sulfur atoms of
DE   cysteines from the protein.
SY   [2Fe-2S] cluster; [Fe2S2] cluster; 2 iron, 2 sulfur cluster binding;
SY   Di-mu-sulfido-diiron; Fe2/S2 (inorganic) cluster; Fe2S2.
GO   GO:0051537; 2 iron, 2 sulfur cluster binding
HI   Ligand: 2Fe-2S.
CA   Ligand.
//
ID   3D-structure.
AC   KW-0002
DE   Protein, or part of a protein, whose three-dimensional structure has
DE   been resolved experimentally (for example by X-ray crystallography or
DE   NMR spectroscopy) and whose coordinates are available in the PDB
DE   database. Can also be used for theoretical models.
HI   Technical term: 3D-structure.
CA   Technical term.
//
ID   3Fe-4S.
AC   KW-0003
DE   Protein which contains at least one 3Fe-4S iron-sulfur cluster: 3 iron
DE   atoms complexed to 4 inorganic sulfides and 3 sulfur atoms of
DE   cysteines from the protein. In a number of iron-sulfur proteins, the
DE   4Fe-4S cluster can be reversibly converted by oxidation and loss of
DE   one iron ion to a 3Fe-4S cluster.
GO   GO:0051538; 3 iron, 4 sulfur cluster binding
HI   Ligand: 2Fe-2S; 3Fe-4S.
CA   Ligand.
//
ID   4Fe-4S.
AC   KW-0004
DE   Protein which contains at least one 4Fe-4S iron-sulfur cluster: 4 iron
DE   atoms complexed to 4 inorganic sulfides and 4 sulfur atoms of
DE   cysteines from the protein. In a number of iron-sulfur proteins, the
DE   4Fe-4S cluster can be reversibly converted by oxidation and loss of
DE   one iron ion to a 3Fe-4S cluster.
GO   GO:0051539; 4 iron, 4 sulfur cluster binding
HI   Ligand: 4Fe-4S.
CA   Ligand.
//
ID   Alternative splicing.
AC   KW-0025
DE   Protein for which at least two isoforms exist due to distinct pre-mRNA
DE   splicing events.
HI   Coding sequence diversity: Alternative splicing.
CA   Coding sequence diversity.
//
ID   Iron.
AC   KW-0408
DE   Protein which binds at least one iron atom, or protein whose function
DE   is iron-dependent. Iron is a metal, chemical symbol Fe.
SY   Fe; Fe cation; Fe ion; Iron cation; Iron ion.
HI   Ligand: Iron.
WW   http://www.webelements.com/iron/
CA   Ligand.
IC   Technical term.
AC   KW-9990
DE   Keywords assigned to proteins according to 'technical' reasons.
//
IC   Ligand.
AC   KW-9993
DE   Keywords assigned to proteins because they bind, are associated with,
DE   or whose activity is dependent of some molecule.
//
IC   Coding sequence diversity.
AC   KW-9997
DE   Keywords assigned to proteins because their sequences can differ, due
DE   to differences in the coding sequences such as polymorphisms, RNA-
DE   editing, alternative splicing.
